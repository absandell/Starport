# Starport


## Inspiration
As a kid, I was fascinated by all things space. Constellations, spaceships, and every pretty much every Sci-Fi property that you could name.  This love of the cosmos has definitely carried over into my adulthood as well. As I've headed into midterms season at University this past week, I've been desperately scouring the web for platforms that allow to remain productive, but immerse myself in the interstellar ambience that I crave. Thus, Starport was born. 
## What it does
Starport is a both a productivity and relaxation project. Users are able to add their own tasks with detailed information to a list, checking them off as they complete their goals. Additionally, users are encouraged to work in hour-long blocks of time with ambient audio and an alarm to help them stay focused. As they get to working, ambient, celestial-inspired audio plays softly in the background as the stars fly by in the background.

## How we built it
I built Starport primarily using Vue along with HTML and CSS for styling. Data is stored on a local JSON Server, and I have plans to fully deploy the project on my personal website in the coming days.

## Challenges we ran into
Given that this was a solo project, a lot of the challenges that I encountered were primarily due to issues in my early designs and rushed planning due to a lack of ability to delegate. I also switched projects halfway through the Hackathon, and I'm incredibly glad that I did so as my initial plans were incredibly unrealistic for the given time-constraints. A technical issue that was a frustration was my inability to properly implement randomized background-gif switching upon page reload. By any and all accounts, it should have worked, so I'm eager to see if I can figure it out in the coming days.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
In a shocking twist, I took my first foray into digital art this hackathon! I made the user dashboard entirely in Microsoft paint, and I'm really proud with how well(ish) it turned out!

## What we learned
Sometimes the first, or even most developed idea you have is not the best one. I'm used to jumping head-first into projects the minute that I come up with an idea, and this time it backfired in the best of ways. Approaching everything with flexibility and an open mind is extremely rewarding.

## What's next for Starport
I will soon be moving the data stored in the JSON Server into a MySQL database with OAuth functionality. This should make the full functionality of the project accessible to users.
